# AI Studio

**A Unified, Modular, and Automated AI Tool Deployment & Management Platform for macOS**

AI Studio is a comprehensive, bash-based toolkit designed to simplify the deployment, management, and maintenance of local AI tools on macOS. Assuming a "zero-environment" starting point, it automatically detects system requirements, installs missing dependencies, and provides a standardized, unified interface for daily operations, granular updates, and self-diagnosis.

## ✨ Core Features

- 🚀 **Zero-Configuration Start**: Automatically detects the macOS environment. If requirements are not met, it seamlessly installs missing dependencies (Homebrew, Python, Node.js, Git, Ollama, etc.) before proceeding with deployment.
- 🌐 **Auto-Open Browser**: Upon successful service startup, the script automatically detects the running port and invokes the system's default browser to open the corresponding Web UI.
- 🧩 **Highly Modular**: All 9 major AI components are deployed and managed completely independently. Installing, updating, or uninstalling one component will not interfere with others.
- 🩺 **Built-in Self-Diagnosis**: Features both "Simple" and "Deep" diagnostic modes to automatically identify port conflicts, missing dependencies, or zombie processes, with an optional one-click auto-fix (`--fix`) capability.
- 📈 **Progressive Disclosure**: Commands are layered from simple daily operations (`start`/`stop`) to advanced expert configurations (`--target`, `--deep`), revealing complexity only when needed to lower the learning curve.
- 🔄 **Granular Updates**: Supports independent updates for specific targets: `frontend`, `agent`, `architecture`, or `models`, saving time and bandwidth by avoiding full re-downloads.

## 💻 System Requirements

- **Operating System**: macOS 13.0 (Ventura) or later.
- **Hardware Architecture**: 
  - General components: Intel or Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4).
  - **MLX / MLX-Video / ComfyUI**: **Strongly recommended to use Apple Silicon** for optimal hardware acceleration and performance.
- **RAM**: Minimum 16GB (32GB or more is highly recommended for running large LLMs or FLUX image generation models).
- **Storage**: At least 50GB of free space (100GB+ is recommended to accommodate large model weights).
- **Network**: A stable internet connection is required for the initial deployment and model downloads.

## 🚀 Quick Start

For first-time users starting with **no pre-existing environment**, follow these 4 simple steps to prepare your system and launch your first component:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository to your local machine
git clone https://github.com/r4fpsdmyr7-blip/AI-Studio-Docs.git
cd ai-studio-docs

# 2. Grant execution permissions to the main script
chmod +x ai-studio.sh

# 3. Check and install the system environment 
# (This will automatically install missing dependencies like Homebrew, Python, Node, etc.)
./ai-studio.sh env check
./ai-studio.sh env install

# 4. Deploy and start Open WebUI 
# (The browser will automatically open upon successful startup)
./ai-studio.sh install open-webui
./ai-studio.sh start open-webui
```

## 📖 Detailed Usage Guide

AI Studio employs a **Progressive Disclosure** design. Below is the detailed command guide categorized by usage scenarios.

### 1. Environment Management
```bash
./ai-studio.sh env check      # Only check if the system environment meets requirements (no installation)
./ai-studio.sh env install    # Automatically install all missing system-level dependencies
./ai-studio.sh env status     # View a summary of the current system environment status
```

### 2. Component Lifecycle (Deployment & Uninstall)
```bash
# Initial / Individual Deployment
./ai-studio.sh install <component>       # Deploy a single specific component (e.g., comfyui)
./ai-studio.sh install all               # Initial deployment of all supported components

# Stop & Uninstall
./ai-studio.sh uninstall <component>     # Uninstall the specified component
./ai-studio.sh uninstall <component> --keep-data  # Uninstall the component but retain user data and downloaded models
./ai-studio.sh uninstall <component> --force      # Force uninstall (ignores warnings about residual processes)
```

### 3. Daily Usage & Status
```bash
# Start & Stop
./ai-studio.sh start <component>         # Start the service (automatically opens the browser upon success)
./ai-studio.sh stop <component>          # Gracefully stop the service
./ai-studio.sh restart <component>       # Restart the service

# View Status
./ai-studio.sh status                    # View the running status and port usage of all components
./ai-studio.sh status <component>        # View detailed running status of a single component
./ai-studio.sh list                      # List all available components and their metadata
```

### 4. Granular Updates
Supports independent updates for different parts of a component to save time and bandwidth:
```bash
./ai-studio.sh update <component>                      # Full update of the component
./ai-studio.sh update <component> --target frontend    # Update frontend code only
./ai-studio.sh update <component> --target agent       # Update Agent logic only
./ai-studio.sh update <component> --target architecture# Update underlying architecture or system dependencies only
./ai-studio.sh update <component> --target models      # Pull/update model weight files only
```

### 5. Self-Diagnosis
Use the diagnostic features when a service fails to start or behaves abnormally:
```bash
./ai-studio.sh diagnose <component>          # Simple diagnosis (checks processes, ports, basic logs)
./ai-studio.sh diagnose <component> --deep   # Deep diagnosis (checks dependency versions, config files, RAM/VRAM usage)
./ai-studio.sh diagnose <component> --deep --fix  # Deep diagnosis and attempt to automatically fix identified issues
```

## 🏗️ Architecture & Design Principles

1. **Progressive Disclosure**
   - **Level 0 (Minimal)**: `start`, `stop`, `status` — Covers 90% of daily usage.
   - **Level 1 (Standard)**: `install`, `update`, `diagnose` — Covers deployment and maintenance needs.
   - **Level 2 (Advanced)**: `--target`, `--deep`, `--keep-data` — Covers fine-grained control requirements.
   - **Level 3 (Expert)**: Directly modifying configuration files in the `config/` directory or editing component scripts.

2. **Standardization**
   Every component in the `components/<name>/` directory strictly contains 8 standard scripts: `metadata.sh`, `install.sh`, `start.sh`, `stop.sh`, `status.sh`, `update.sh`, `diagnose.sh`, and `uninstall.sh`. The main script calls them through a unified interface, eliminating the need to memorize unique commands for different tools.

3. **Modularization**
   - **Core Libraries (`lib/`)**: Provide universal underlying capabilities such as logging, color output, process management, and browser control.
   - **Registry (`registry.sh`)**: Centrally manages metadata for all components (names, ports, descriptions).
   - **Components (`components/`)**: Business logic is completely isolated. Deleting a component directory will never affect other components.

4. **Universality**
   Whether it is a Python-based ComfyUI, a Node.js-based SillyTavern, or an Ollama-based QWen3, the main script abstracts away the underlying language differences through an abstraction layer, providing a perfectly consistent CLI experience to the user.
